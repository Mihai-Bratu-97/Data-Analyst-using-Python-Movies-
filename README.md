# Data-Analyst-using-Python-Movies-
In this project, I took a dataframe that contains movies, I analysed it in two ways, I made predictions using two machine learning models, and,
at the end, I tested the model using another movies that weren't in that dataframe. I used Python to do all of this. It was tested only on Windows.

First of all, you have to install python in your pc, if you don't have it already. You can download it even from microsoft store, or you can google it
and download it from the first site that appears.
