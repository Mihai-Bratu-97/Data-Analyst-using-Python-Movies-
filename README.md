# Data Analyst using Python-Movies dataframe
In this project, I took a dataframe that contains movies, I analysed it in two ways, I made predictions using two machine learning models, and,
at the end, I tested the model using another movies that weren't in that dataframe. I used Python to do all of this. It was tested only on Windows.
